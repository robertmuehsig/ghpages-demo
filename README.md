KnowYourStack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Code-Inside/KnowYourStack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Code-Inside/KnowYourStack)
===

KownYourStack hosts and produces "Stack"-Dashboards. It uses the [Sloader Crawler](https://github.com/Code-Inside/Sloader) to read "common" community data (e.g. blogs, github data etc.) and stores them here. 

Then GitHub Pages picks up the data and serves as a simple HTML page.
