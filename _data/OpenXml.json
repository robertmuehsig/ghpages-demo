The combo charts are those that mix series of different chart types. A combo chart can be done using Word as shown at the screenshot:\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27296704/40357379-4cb39ce6-5dbc-11e8-9440-dc050b7c3ce6.png)\r\n\r\nWe have tested the current ChartUpdater component for replacing the values of this chart in a DOCX:\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27296704/40357386-53e63dfc-5dbc-11e8-9e1e-475d3d3267a1.png)\r\n\r\nThis chart combines two series: one is a bar chart and the other a line chart, with only the dots and in the secondary axis.\r\n\r\nWe provide in this repository an application that tests this: \r\nhttps://github.com/VictorIranzo/UpdateComboChart \r\n\r\nThe result obtained is not the expected one. It seems that the ChartUpdater has added the new values of the two series in the bar chart section and has kept the section of the line chart. We couldn’t open the output document using Word, but if we use another editor like LibreOffice we see the mentioned result:\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27296704/40357400-5ca8e692-5dbc-11e8-9a7b-4bdb94b3e685.png)\r\n\r\nAs you see, there are 3 series. The ‘Percentage’ series contains the data of the old chart. If we remove the line series manually opening the ‘chart1.xml’ file of the document, we realize that the values provided for the new chart have been inserted in the bar chart section:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27296704/40357421-6c11038a-5dbc-11e8-924d-ce533c87e458.png)\r\n \r\nAs we said, we are interested in this feature. We would like to know if you have planned to implement this feature.\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7684222300","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-16T15:44:11","Actor":"dionisor","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/223","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Unable to Import Module Open-xml-powertools\" (#223) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"I want to use powershell modules so I´ve tried next instructions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe short form of the installation instructions are:\r\n\r\n1.
