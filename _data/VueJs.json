This causes problems when webpack decides to load a different instance of vue. \r\nSee https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/4068\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n[Local registration](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html#Local-Registration) to accept a function that **synchronously** returns a component, calling it with the parent vue instance. \r\n\r\nThe library can then do:\r\n```ts\r\nexport default function MyComponent (Vue: VueConstructor) {\r\n  return Vue.extend({ ... })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd be used like:\r\n```js\r\nimport MyComponent from 'some-library'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: { MyComponent }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course that would then cause other problems, particularly where we use methods directly from other components. Maybe something that adds types like `Vue.extend()` but doesn't have any runtime behaviour would be better instead?\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// When used, this will behave the same as a bare options object, instead of being an entire vue instance\r\nexport default Vue.component({\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

First, I was realy enthusiastic about vue and all its features but I found that something was missing: a way to declare a model/entity to represent a data object.\r\n\r\nI don't know what you are thinking about a such feature but I think it could be a good option to add an other library (like the router, or even the cli) to guide vue developers with data manipulations and in the same way, promote best practices in this field.\r\n\r\nThank you to consider my proposition.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMy proposition is to integrate a library to bring the M from MVC to the V from Vue of course without dealing with persistence. Or at least to guide developers to deal with this implementation. The data attribute of a Vue component could be composed of multiple models instance, because a component is not a data object itself and it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This would be a great addition to vue-router, router link elements.\r\n\r\nThe following points are cited from the vue-router documents: \r\n>It works the same way in both HTML5 history mode and hash mode, so if you ever decide to switch mode, or when the router falls back to hash mode in IE9, nothing needs to be changed.\r\n\r\n>In HTML5 history mode, router-link will intercept the click event so that the browser doesn't try to reload the page.\r\n\r\n>When you are using the base option in HTML5 history mode, you don't need to include it in to prop's URLs.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases where the user may wish to open a router-link in a new window, in order to maximize productivity. For example, our team is currently rebuilding an internal campaign management system. There are several sections to this, which can be viewed simultaneously by our end users. The users prefer the option to open multiple tabs, in order to see sets of data side-by-side. \r\n\r\nAt present, there is no context menu associated with view router links--right-clicks open the standard browser context menu. This prevents offering the user the *option* to navigate to a link in a new tab. \r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd an optional context menu feature to router-link elements. The feature would include the following: \r\n- mimic browser's native right-click context menu for anchor tags\r\n- open a router-link using the `target=_blank` method, when option selected by user from context menu\r\n- open router-links in same tab by default\r\n- optional: only include the context menu if a property is set to true within the code (TBD) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n`<router-link to=\"/my-route\" has-context-menu=\"true\"></router-link>`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I don't think this line of reasoning holds in the Vue/Vuex world. In almost all other aspects of Vue/Vuex, the API looks straight forward (e.g. just getting and setting properties), but under the hood a lot of additional logic runs (dependency tracking, etc.). So there is really no need to make committing mutations more cumbersome than they need to be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the code harder to read, this leads to additional rules about argument passing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is very hard to spot typos in the mutation name early on, as the mutation name is just a string - let alone checking that the call to `commit()` received the correct arguments according to the mutation function. These types of errors should be easy to spot at compile time, but with the current syntax, these are all pushed into runtime.\r\n\r\nFinally, this cumbersome syntax might be (correctly) perceived as boilerplate, especially to beginners. Hence, replacing the commit syntax with a more straight forward syntax might improve the adoption of Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit('someMutation', args...)\r\n\r\none should be allowed to write:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would be great if looking at `this.$store` in the developer console all available mutation methods are shown. That is, the methods should be real properties of this.$store, collected once at program start.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, of course, these methods might all call some central commit() function.\r\n\r\nAlternative syntax: The above syntax might introduce some name collisions. For example, someone might name one of their mutations \"state\", for whatever reason, making \"this.$store.state\" ambiguous. For the sake of simplicity, these names should just be forbidden as mutation names. But if this is not an option for whatever reason, an intermediate object might do the trick as well. This would be less beautiful, but still better than what we have today:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nor shorter:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.c.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nAs an additional proposal, the old `this.$store.commit()` syntax should be marked deprecated.  And removed in future Vuex versions. This generic call is not needed. Any generic commit call might as well be formulated as `this.$store[mutationName](args...)`, which is still easy to understand and even shorter than `this.$store.commit(mutationName, args...)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

EG\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst createStore = () => new Vuex.Store({\r\n  state: {\r\n    version: null,\r\n  },\r\n  getters: {\r\n    version(state){\r\n        return state.version;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  setters: {\r\n    setVersion(state, version){\r\n      state.version = version;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't currently understand the life cycle or structure of the store well enough to programmatically add getters and setters.  Naively, I tried implementing a module to automatically generate a `getters` object to inject into the store something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default (state) => {\r\n  let result = Object.keys(state)\r\n    .reduce((getters, key) => {\r\n      const getterMethodName = `${key.charAt(0)}${[...key].slice(1,).join('')}`;\r\n      getters[getterMethodName] = function(state){ return state[key]};\r\n      return getters;\r\n    }, {});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis didn't work, and I'm not sure how to proceed, but it seems like providing vanilla getters and setters that are a function of the property name, but could be overridden with an explicit implementation would make Vuex development friendlier and faster.\r\n\r\nThis idea could be extended to actions and mutations.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to point out problems with this idea or my understanding of the store, or even better, that someone has already implemented it and where!\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo visible changes to the current store creation API would be required.
